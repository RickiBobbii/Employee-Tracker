## Credits

 1. This application is an assignment from module 12 from [The Ohio State University Coding Boot Camp](https://eng-bootcamps.osu.edu/).  The Acceptance Criteria above is from the challenge in module 12.
 2. The queryDepartments function, viewAllEmployees query, and decimal validation function were made with help from Bing AI.
 3. Application uses console.table for a cleaner table look.  It already comes with node.js.  For more information on console.table [click here](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_console_table.asp).

## Future Development

Express has been added for possible future use.  I would also like to add better manager selection to the add employee option.
